title: Disabling SEP
id: 4a6713f6-3331-11ed-a261-0242ac120002
status: experimental
description: detects one of the possible scenarios for disabling symantec endpoint protection. Symantec Endpoint Protection antivirus software services incorrectly implement the protected service mechanism. As a result, the NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM user can execute the taskkill /im command several times ccSvcHst.exe /f, thereby killing the process belonging to the service, and thus shutting down the service.
